Unique IDs and their descriptive
================================
"Test_Subject" - The subjects (70% generated the "Train" data and 30% generated the "Test" data - conducting the specific activities for the experiment (30 subjects)
"Activity_ID" - The unique ID for each activity (1~6)
"Activity" - The activity descriptive (6 activities in total)
"Type" - The identifier of which group the data was generated from ("Train"/"Test")

The Mean and Standard Deviation of the Measured Variables
==========================================================
~ Detailed decriptive to reference to feature_info.txt found in the original data set
~ Total 79 measured variables
~ General descriptive: 
	"<data_type><variable type>.<function>.<signal direction>
<data_type>
	"t" - time domain signals
	"FFT" - signal after a Fast Fourier Transform
<variable type>
	Detailed decriptive reference to feature_info.txt
<function>
	mean - mean
	std - standard deviation
<signal direction>
	'XYZ' - used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
