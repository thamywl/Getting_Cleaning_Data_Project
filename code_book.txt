Unique IDs and their descriptive
================================
"Test_Subject" - The subjects (70% generated the "Train" data and 30% generated the "Test" data - conducting the specific activities for the experiment (30 subjects)
"Activity_ID" - The unique ID for each activity (1~6)
"Activity" - The activity descriptive (6 activities in total)
"Type" - The identifier of which group the data was generated from ("Train"/"Test")

The Mean and Standard Deviation of the Measured Variables
==========================================================
~ Detailed decriptive to reference to feature_info.txt found in the original data set
~ Total 79 measured variables
~ General descriptive: 
	<variable_type>.<function>.<signal direction>
<data_type>
	"t" - time domain signals
	"f" - frequency domain signals
<variable type>
	Acc - Body Acceleration, where total acceleration signal obtained from the smartphone accelerometer subtracting gravity (m/s^2)
	AccJerk - Body linear acceleration derived in time (m/s^3)
	AccMag - Magnitude of the three-dimensional acceleration signal calculated using the Euclidean norm
	AccJerkMag - Magnitude of the three-dimensional jerk calculated using the Euclidean norm
	Gyro - The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. (rad/s)
	GyroJerkMag - Magnitude of the three-dimensional Angular velocity derived in time calculated using the Euclidean norm
	GyroMag - Magnitude of the three-dimensional angular velocity calculated using the Euclidean norm
	GravityAcc - Gravity (m/s^2)
	GravityAccMag - Magnitude of the three-dimensional gravity calculated using the Euclidean norm


<function>
	mean - mean
	std - standard deviation
	meanFreq - Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

<signal direction>
	'XYZ' - used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
